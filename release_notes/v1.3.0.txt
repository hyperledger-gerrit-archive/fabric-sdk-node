v1.3.0 Oct 10, 2018
-----------------------

Release Notes
-------------
Fabric 1.3.0 has removed EventHub service and therefore the fabric-client has
   removed the EventHub class. This has been replaced by the Fabric Channel Event
   Service and fabric-client ChannelEventHub class.
   The ChannelEventHub uses the more reliable and better performant fabric block
   delivery service. The ChannelEventHub will be able to replace the EventHub class
   in your code as the ChannelEventHub has similar API's to the removed EventHub
   class
      see https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/ChannelEventHub.html.
